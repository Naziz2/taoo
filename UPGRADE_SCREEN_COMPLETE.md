When user upgrades, the following fields are updated:

user.level = selectedPlan; // 'basic' | 'silver' | 'gold'
user.monthlyLimit = selectedPlan === 'gold' ? 15000 : selectedPlan === 'silver' ? 7500 : 0;
user.maxSplitMonths = selectedPlan === 'gold' ? 12 : selectedPlan === 'silver' ? 6 : 0;
```

#### Local State:
- `selectedPlan`: Currently selected plan for upgrade
- `modalVisible`: Confirmation modal visibility
- `successModalVisible`: Success modal visibility

### üîê Business Logic

#### Plan Selection Rules:
1. **Current Plan**: Button disabled, shows "Current Plan"
2. **Lower Tiers**: Disabled for users with higher plans
3. **Upgrade Only**: Users can only upgrade, not downgrade
4. **Gold Users**: Upgrade button hidden (already at max tier)

#### Upgrade Process:
1. Validate selected plan is higher than current
2. Show confirmation with price
3. Simulate payment processing (500ms delay)
4. Update user level in context
5. Update monthly limits
6. Show success confirmation
7. Auto-navigate back after 2 seconds
