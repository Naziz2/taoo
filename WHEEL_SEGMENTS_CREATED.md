# Programmatic Wheel Segments Created

## ‚úÖ What Was Done

### 1. Installed react-native-svg
```bash
npm install react-native-svg
```
This package allows us to draw vector graphics programmatically.

### 2. Created SpinWheel Component (NEW)
**File:** `mobile/src/components/SpinWheel.tsx`

This component programmatically draws a beautiful spinning wheel with:
- **8 colored segments** alternating between `#EAB308` (yellow) and `#F59E0B` (orange)
- **SVG paths** for precise segment shapes
- **Dark borders** (#374151) between segments
- **Text labels** showing point values on each segment
- **Golden outer ring** (#EAB308) for decoration
- **Center circle** ready for logo overlay

### 3. Updated DailyRewardsScreen
**File:** `mobile/src/screens/DailyRewardsScreen.tsx`

Changes:
- Imported the new `SpinWheel` component
- Wrapped it in `Animated.View` for rotation
- Added center logo overlay (using existing logo.png)
- Added red pointer triangle at top
- Simplified the wheel wrapper structure

### 4. Wheel Segments

The wheel now has 8 segments with these values and probabilities:

| Segment | Points | Probability | Color |
|---------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | 50 | 40% | Yellow (#EAB308) |
| 2 | 100 | 10% | Orange (#F59E0B) |
| 3 | 20 | 30% | Yellow (#EAB308) |
| 4 | 500 | 4% | Orange (#F59E0B) |
| 5 | 200 | 10% | Yellow (#EAB308) |
| 6 | 1000 | 2% | Orange (#F59E0B) |
| 7 | 700 | 3% | Yellow (#EAB308) |
| 8 | 2000 | 1% | Orange (#F59E0B) |

### 5. Visual Design

The wheel features:
- **Outer yellow border** - Golden ring (#EAB308) with 8px width
- **Dark segment borders** - Dark gray (#374151) separates each segment
- **Alternating colors** - Yellow and orange segments
- **Bold text** - 18px font size, bold, dark gray color
- **Center circle** - White background with dark border
- **Red pointer** - Triangle at top indicates winning segment
- **Logo in center** - Your Cashlik logo displayed in the middle

### 6. How It Works

1. **Segments are drawn using SVG Paths** - Each segment is a precise wedge shape
2. **Text is rotated** - Numbers are positioned and rotated to follow the wheel curve
3. **Entire wheel rotates** - The Animated.View rotates the whole SVG wheel
4. **Center logo stays fixed** - Overlaid on top with higher z-index
5. **Pointer indicates winner** - Red triangle at top shows which segment won

## üé® Benefits

- ‚úÖ **No external images needed** - Everything drawn programmatically
- ‚úÖ **Crisp at any size** - SVG scales perfectly
- ‚úÖ **Easy to customize** - Change colors, segments, values in code
- ‚úÖ **Professional look** - Clean borders and smooth segments
- ‚úÖ **Performant** - Smooth 60fps rotation animation

## üöÄ Next Steps

The wheel is now ready to use! You can:
1. Test the spinning animation
2. Adjust colors if needed (edit `SpinWheel.tsx`)
3. Change segment values or probabilities (edit `DailyRewardsScreen.tsx`)
4. Customize the center logo

## üìÅ Files Modified/Created

- ‚úÖ **CREATED:** `mobile/src/components/SpinWheel.tsx` (new SVG wheel component)
- ‚úÖ **MODIFIED:** `mobile/src/screens/DailyRewardsScreen.tsx` (integrated SpinWheel)
- ‚úÖ **INSTALLED:** `react-native-svg` package

No image files needed - everything is drawn programmatically! üéâ
