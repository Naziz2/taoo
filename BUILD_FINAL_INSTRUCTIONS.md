# 🚀 APK Build - Final Setup & Instructions

## ✅ Configuration Complete!

All files have been configured for successful APK build.

---

## 📋 What Was Fixed

### Problem 1: Missing Asset Files
**Error:** `ENOENT: no such file or directory, open './assets/adaptive-icon.png'`

**Solution:**
- Removed icon file references from `app.json`
- Using color-based adaptive icon instead
- App will use default Expo icon (temporary)
- Build can proceed without image assets

### Problem 2: Gradle Build Errors  
**Solution:**
- Simplified `app.json` configuration
- Removed unnecessary permissions
- Added explicit Gradle command in `eas.json`
- Added `appVersionSource: "remote"` to EAS config

---

## 🎯 To Build APK Now

### Method 1: Using Batch Script (Easiest)
```cmd
Double-click: build-apk.bat
```
This script will:
1. Navigate to correct directory

3. Show progress and build URL

### Method 2: Manual Commands
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\aziz\Desktop\Do-shopping\mobile"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails - Check Logs
Visit the build URL provided in terminal:
```
https://expo.dev/accounts/[username]/projects/cashlik-mobile/builds/[build-id]
```

Click on each build phase to see detailed logs.

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Not logged in"
```powershell
eas login
```

#### 2. "Project not found"
Make sure you're in the mobile directory:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\aziz\Desktop\Do-shopping\mobile"
```

#### 3. "Dependency version mismatch"
```powershell
npm install
```

#### 4. "Gradle build failed"
- Check build logs for specific error
- Usually resolved by simplifying app.json
- May need to remove conflicting plugins

### Still Failing?
1. Check: https://expo.dev (build dashboard)
2. Review: Build logs for specific errors
3. Try: `eas build --platform android --profile preview --clear-cache`
