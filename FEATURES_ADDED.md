# Features Added to React Native App

## ✅ Authentication Flow
The app now has a complete **3-step phone authentication** system:

### AuthScreen (src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx)
- **Step 1**: Phone number input with country code (+966 Saudi Arabia)
- **Step 2**: OTP verification (4-digit code)
- **Step 3**: Profile creation (first name, last name)
- Auto-focus on OTP inputs
- Resend OTP timer (60 seconds)
- Full validation and error handling
- Seamless integration with AsyncStorage for persistence

### How it works:
1. User enters phone number
2. Receives OTP (simulated)
3. Enters OTP code
4. Creates profile (new users only)
5. Automatically logged in and navigated to main app

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Technologies Used:
- **React Native Animated API** for wheel spinning
- **AsyncStorage** for user persistence
- **React Navigation** (Stack + Bottom Tabs)
- **TypeScript** with proper type definitions
- **Expo Vector Icons** (MaterialCommunityIcons)
- **Context API** (UserContext, LanguageContext, ThemeContext)

### Key Code Patterns:
```typescript
// Composite navigation for accessing parent navigator
type HomeScreenNavigationProp = CompositeNavigationProp<
  BottomTabNavigationProp<MainTabParamList, 'Home'>,
  StackNavigationProp<RootStackParamList>
>;

// Weighted random selection for fair prize distribution
const generateWeightedRandom = (): WheelSegment | null => {
  // Uses cumulative probability distribution
  // Ensures realistic odds for each prize tier
};

// Smooth wheel animation
Animated.timing(rotation, {
  toValue: randomRotation,
  duration: 3000,
  useNativeDriver: true,
}).start();
```
