# Authentication Flow Fix - Summary

## Problem
After completing authentication in AuthScreen, the app was not redirecting to the home page.

## Root Cause
The app was checking for Supabase authentication state, but the AuthScreen was using a custom phone-based authentication flow that didn't integrate with Supabase.

## Solution
Implemented a custom authentication system using AsyncStorage and React Context:

### 1. Created UserContext (`src/contexts/UserContext.tsx`)
- Manages user state across the app
- Provides `user`, `setUser`, and `logout` functions
- Persists user data between app launches

### 2. Updated App.tsx
- Replaced Supabase auth with AsyncStorage
- Added `handleAuthSuccess` to save user data and set authentication state
- Added `handleLogout` to clear user data
- Wrapped app with UserProvider
- Passes callbacks to AppNavigator

### 3. Updated AppNavigator.tsx
- Accepts `onAuthSuccess`, `onLogout`, and `userData` props
- Passes `onAuthSuccess` to AuthScreen
- Still uses `isAuthenticated` to control navigation

### 4. Updated AuthScreen.tsx
- Already had complete 3-step phone authentication (phone → OTP → profile)
- Now properly calls `onAuthSuccess` with user data
- User data is saved to AsyncStorage automatically

### 5. Updated AccountScreen.tsx
- Uses `useUser()` hook to access user data and logout function
- Displays actual user name, phone, and level
- Logout button now works with confirmation dialog
- Clears AsyncStorage and returns to auth screen

## Authentication Flow

### New User Journey:
1. **Phone Entry** → Enter Saudi phone number (+966 XX XXX XXXX)
2. **OTP Verification** → Enter 4-digit code (use "1234" for testing)
3. **Profile Completion** → Enter first and last name
4. **Home Screen** → Automatically redirected after registration

### Existing User Journey:
1. **Phone Entry** → Enter phone number
2. **OTP Verification** → Enter code (use "1234" for testing)
3. **Home Screen** → Automatically redirected (skips profile step)

### Logout Flow:
1. User taps logout button in Account screen
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User confirms logout
4. User data cleared from AsyncStorage
5. App redirects to Auth screen

## User Data Structure
```typescript
{
  id: string;
  phone: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  level: 'basic' | 'silver' | 'gold' | 'platinum';
  points: number;
  accountComplited: number; // percentage
  monthlyLimit: number; // SAR
  usedThisMonth: number; // SAR
  availableLimit: number;
  maxSplitMonths: number;
  accountAgeDays: number;
  interests: string[];
  referralCode: string;
  isNewUser: boolean;
}
```

## Testing
1. Start the app → Should show Auth screen
2. Enter any phone number → Tap "Send Code"
3. Enter OTP "1234" → Tap "Verify Code"
4. If new user: Enter name → Tap "Complete Registration"
5. Should redirect to Home screen with bottom navigation
6. Go to Account screen → See your user data
7. Tap logout → Confirm → Should return to Auth screen
8. Restart app → Should still be logged in (persisted in AsyncStorage)

## Files Changed
- ✅ `App.tsx` - Auth state management with AsyncStorage
- ✅ `src/contexts/UserContext.tsx` - NEW: User context provider
- ✅ `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` - Pass auth callbacks
- ✅ `src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx` - Already complete (no changes needed)
- ✅ `src/screens/AccountScreen.tsx` - Display user data and implement logout

## Next Steps
To integrate with real backend:
1. Replace mock OTP verification with actual API call
2. Replace AsyncStorage with Supabase auth or custom backend
3. Update UserContext to sync with backend
4. Add error handling for network failures
5. Implement token refresh logic
